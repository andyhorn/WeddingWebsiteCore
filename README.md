# Wedding Website
Celebrating the wedding of Andrew Horn and Krystal Cruz.



## Overview

This website is based off of the wedding templates available on sites like Minted and Zora but expands on the capabilities to provide a more useful, customizable toolset.

Some of the features include:

* Keeping a guest list with contact information, family details, and addresses
* Tracking (and presenting) a list of individuals with roles in the wedding itself:
  * Bridesmaids
  * Groomsmen
  * Maids of Honor
  * Best Men
  * Ring Bearer
  * Flower Girls
  * Parents 
  * Grandparents
* Generating and tracking RSVP information for guests - Each guest/family will receive a unique code in their invitation; They can then use this code on the website to identify/authenticate themselves and respond to the RSVP with a confirmation of their attendance or non-attendance
* Tracking (and presenting) vendor information
* Tracking (and presenting) event information, such as location, start time, and end time
